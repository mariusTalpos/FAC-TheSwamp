**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-05-26): All items pass.
- Validation iteration 2 (2026-05-26): Updated per product owner—fighter self-registration for all events; no team captain approval. All items still pass.
- Validation iteration 3 (2026-05-26): Event organizer model clarified—global multi-holder role, one organizer per event (creator), multi-role participation allowed, guest accounts deferred. All items still pass.
- Validation iteration 4 (2026-05-26): FAC administrators may reassign an event’s organizer (to another user with the global organizer role). All items still pass.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan` or optional `/speckit-clarify` if FAC wants to lock policy on public event pages, organizer approval queues, or credential gates before planning.
